=====

A frontend for roguelikes or other games using an ASCII display which captures keypresses from users and dumps entire screens of ASCII to players.  This moves all processing to server-side and thus one client and one server architecture is all that are required for Every ASCII Game Ever.  Currently comes with a "Tag" demo game.
