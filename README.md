A cross-platform frontend for multiplayer roguelikes or other games using an ASCII display which captures keypresses from users and dumps entire screens of ASCII to players.  This moves all processing server-side and thus one client and one server architecture are all that are required for Every ASCII Game Ever.  Currently comes with a "Tag" demo game.
